## Meet SAM - your intelligent, hands‑free assistant

In July 2025, I set out to build the AI assistant my wife actually wanted: one that adapted to *her* workflow instead of forcing her to adapt. SAM was made for her - and dedicated to her. It has since grown into a native macOS assistant that anyone can use to get real work done.

A native macOS app designed for **non‑developers** who want powerful tools in their everyday life.  
Review documents, create images, write content, plan projects, or just have a conversation.  
Say **"Hey SAM"** to go hands‑free, or type naturally.  
You're always in control.

**Your data stays on your Mac. Always.**  
(Switch to cloud AI providers only if you want to.)

## Why you'll love SAM

### 🤖 **Real assistance, not just answers**
SAM helps you finish things.  
Whether it's organizing files, helping you draft documents, creating images, or researching a topic - SAM acts on your ideas.

### 🧠 **Smart memory**
SAM remembers what matters across conversations.  
Create "Shared Topics" to connect chats around the same project, and find anything you've shared with semantic search.

### 🎤 **Just say "Hey SAM"**
Full voice control lets you keep your hands free.  
Ask questions, give commands, or have a conversation - all without touching the keyboard.

### 🖼️ **Create images in seconds**
Generate beautiful images locally with Stable Diffusion.  
No subscriptions, no cloud uploads - just your imagination and SAM's creativity.

### 🔐 **Privacy you can trust**
All your conversations, documents, and memories stay on your Mac.  
SAM works with local AI models by default, and only uses cloud AI when you choose to.

### 🧩 **No technical skills needed**
Designed for everyday users - not just developers.  
SAM's clean interface and natural interactions make powerful AI accessible to everyone.
