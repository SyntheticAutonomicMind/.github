## Our Philosophy

We believe AI should:

- **Respect your privacy** - Your data stays where you control it
- **Be transparent** - You understand what's happening and why
- **Work your way** - Adapt to your workflow, not the reverse
- **Empower, not replace** - AI should help you accomplish more, not take over
- **Be accessible** - Powerful tools should work for everyone, not just developers

All our projects are **100% free & open source** under GPL v3.0 (code) and CC BY-NC 4.0 (documentation).
